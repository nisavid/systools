# Cloud Quota Manager

Cloud Quota Manager presents effective quota state and manages quota requests, targets, and grants. Its first complete product workflows cover Compute accelerator quotas for NVIDIA GPUs and TPUs while its core domain remains applicable to other quota families.

## Language

**Cloud Quota Manager**:
The product for inspecting effective quotas and managing quota requests, targets, and grants.
_Avoid_: Cloud Quotas manager, GPU capacity manager

**cqmgr**:
The executable, package stem, and repository tool name for Cloud Quota Manager.
_Avoid_: cloud-quotas, quota

**Quota inspector**:
The primary interactive workspace for browsing constraint sets and exact effective quota slices, inspecting their evidence, and entering valid next operations without losing resource-scope context.
_Avoid_: Dashboard, operation launcher

**Resource scope**:
The canonical project, folder, or organization within which the manager reads quota or manages a quota request. It is distinct from a quota's regional, global, or zonal scope.
_Avoid_: Target, default project

**Resource-scope selection**:
An explicit local selection of one resource scope that read operations and Preview may reuse visibly. It never comes from ambient `gcloud` state and never substitutes for Apply's exact resource-scope acknowledgement.
_Avoid_: Default project, ADC quota project

**Quota target**:
The absolute desired limit requested for one exact effective quota slice.
_Avoid_: Quota increment, quota request amount, quota preference

**Quota request**:
The operator and provider lifecycle that asks Google to reconcile one exact slice toward a quota target and reports the resulting grant.
_Avoid_: Quota preference, change request

**Quota preference**:
The Google Cloud `QuotaPreference` resource that stores the provider identity, requested target, granted value, etag, and reconciliation evidence for a quota request. Use this term only for provider-resource detail and structured provenance.
_Avoid_: Product-facing request, quota target

**Quota request plan**:
A time-bounded, single-use authorization to create or amend the provider resource for one exact quota target against freshly validated state.
_Avoid_: Confirmation token, quota request

**Quota contact**:
The verified individual email supplied to Google for a quota request. It is distinct from the authenticated principal that performs the mutation.
_Avoid_: Acting principal, credential identity

**Quota request reconciliation**:
The provider-managed progression from an accepted quota target to a settled grant and enforced effective quota.
_Avoid_: Immediate quota update, synchronous mutation

**Request-settled**:
The provider has ended reconciliation and reported the granted value. Settlement may grant all, some, or none of the quota target.
_Avoid_: Granted, fulfilled

**Quota request status**:
The surface-neutral state of a quota request expressed on separate reconciliation, grant-satisfaction, and effective-confirmation axes. Human headlines are derived from these simultaneous facts.
_Avoid_: Single lifecycle status, provider state detail

**Fully granted**:
A settled quota request whose granted value equals its quota target. It does not by itself prove that the effective quota enforces that value.
_Avoid_: Request-settled, effective-confirmed

**Fully fulfilled**:
A fully granted quota request backed by a fresh effective-quota observation equal to its target and granted values.
_Avoid_: Accepted, request-settled, fully granted

**Operation success boundary**:
The lifecycle condition an operation promises to reach before reporting success. Preview may reach a verified no-op; Apply reaches its boundary only when the provider accepts the bound quota request. Only a watch that requests effective confirmation promises `effective-confirmed`.
_Avoid_: Quota update succeeded, command completed

**Operation result**:
A versioned, surface-neutral record that identifies an operation, resource scope, declared boundary, outcome, completeness, observation times, diagnostics, and operation-specific data whether or not the boundary was reached.
_Avoid_: Raw provider response, rendered command output

**Watch event**:
A versioned, ordered record emitted when a material reconciliation or effective-quota observation changes. Polling ticks and unchanged refreshes are not watch events; a terminal event carries the final operation result.
_Avoid_: Poll result, repeated snapshot

**Watch condition**:
The explicitly selected lifecycle observation a watch promises to reach. A settled condition accepts any settled grant, a fully granted condition requires the grant to equal the quota target, and a fully fulfilled condition additionally requires fresh effective quota to equal both. A fully granted watch fails on a settled partial grant; a fully fulfilled watch continues until fulfillment or its caller-controlled timeout.
_Avoid_: Polling duration, success

**Incomplete observation**:
Usable provider evidence returned with one or more required sources, pages, or refreshes missing. It remains visible with source failures and a non-success operation result, and it cannot satisfy a mutation gate.
_Avoid_: Partial success, partial grant

**Effective-confirmed**:
A quota-request outcome backed by a fresh effective-quota observation that matches the settled grant.
_Avoid_: Success, completed

**Effective quota**:
The quota limit currently granted for one quota dimension and scope.
_Avoid_: Available capacity

**Capacity**:
The physical resources that may be provisioned within effective quota. Effective quota does not guarantee capacity.
_Avoid_: Quota

**Spot capacity advice**:
Provider-produced, read-only evidence about the likelihood and expected runtime of obtaining a specified Spot VM configuration in candidate locations. It is Preview guidance, not quota, a reservation, or a capacity guarantee.
_Avoid_: Available capacity, inventory, stock

**Spot advice comparison**:
A read-only comparison that keeps one exact Spot VM configuration fixed while evaluating explicit candidate locations or all catalog-compatible provider-supported locations with per-location coverage and evidence.
_Avoid_: Accelerator availability search, global capacity search

**Obtainability workspace**:
The primary interactive workspace for building an exact Spot VM configuration and comparing its current obtainability, estimated uptime, historical preemption, price, and coverage across candidate locations.
_Avoid_: Spot workspace, capacity search

**Obtainability rank**:
A transparent lexicographic ordering of comparable location evidence: provider obtainability band descending, product-defined 30-day p90 preemption band ascending, then current total-request price quartile ascending. Each component and derivation remains visible; the rank is not a capacity score or guarantee.
_Avoid_: Composite score, best location, availability rank

**Obtainability score**:
The provider's current likelihood score that a specified Spot VM request with an exact machine configuration, quantity, distribution shape, and candidate locations will succeed.
_Avoid_: Availability, capacity probability, success guarantee

**Historical preemption rate**:
The provider's daily aggregate ratio of preempted Spot VMs to all matching Spot VMs that stopped, for one supported machine type and location. It is not the operator's fleet interruption rate.
_Avoid_: Failure rate, uptime, project preemption rate

**Effective quota slice**:
One effective quota identified by its resource scope, service, quota ID, exact dimensions, and applicable quota scope.
_Avoid_: Quota row, accelerator quota

**Accelerator catalog**:
A view that relates effective quota slices to accelerator, machine, topology, provisioning, unit, location, lifecycle, and restriction metadata.
_Avoid_: Static hardware list, quota allowlist

**Accelerator constraint set**:
The related effective quota slices that can independently limit one accelerator workload, such as regional and all-regions GPU limits.
_Avoid_: Synthesized quota, combined quota

**Quota pool**:
A quota limit for one consumption category, such as standard, preemptible, committed, or virtual-workstation use.
_Avoid_: Provisioning model

**Provisioning model**:
A provider-defined allocation and lifecycle mode such as Standard, Spot, Flex-start, or reservation-bound use.
_Avoid_: Quota pool, quota category

**Compatibility**:
Provider-visible evidence that an accelerator, machine shape, topology, provisioning model, and location can be used together. Compatibility does not imply capacity.
_Avoid_: Availability, capacity

**Discovered**:
Present in authoritative provider data, whether or not the manager recognizes its product semantics.

**Cataloged**:
Recognized by the manager with accelerator-specific semantics and relationships.

**Guided**:
Supported by an accelerator-specific workflow that explains its applicable constraints and choices.

**Mutable**:
Eligible for a quota request after fresh validation of the exact effective quota slice.

**Service owner**:
The Google Cloud service that owns a quota resource.
_Avoid_: Workload service

**Workload consumer**:
A service or workload that consumes quota owned by another service, such as GKE consuming Compute Engine accelerator quota.
_Avoid_: Service owner
